Hi, I'm Becka!
I am an avid learner and web development enthusiast who enjoys building things from scratch. I recently graduated from a Full Stack Web Development boot camp and am eager to embark on a career in this exciting field.

What I love most about web development is that it's constantly evolving, and there's always something new to learn. I'm excited about the prospect of working on new projects and facing new challenges, knowing that I'll be learning and growing with every step.

When I'm not coding, you'll usually find me outdoors with my furry companion, Hiccup. My dog is my constant source of inspiration and motivation, and we love exploring new trails and finding new adventures together.

Through my varied work experiences and my dedication to learning new skills, I've developed a strong work ethic and a knack for problem-solving. I'm excited to bring these skills to a new role as a full stack web developer, where I can continue to learn and grow while building innovative and user-friendly web applications.

This portfolio showcases some of my recent projects and provides an overview of my skills and experience. I hope you enjoy exploring it and getting to know me better!
